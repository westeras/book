# Generating a Custom CA Certificate

It can be beneficial for testing purposes to have your own custom CA for signing certificates.  This comes in handy when securing web based services running on your local machine or on virtual machines.  You can import the CA into your browser and avoid the security warnings you'd get from using self-signed certificates.
